Library Seat Availability & Booking System

Tired of hunting for a library seat? LSABS (Library Seat Availability & Booking System) solves that. Get instant updates on empty spaces across campus libraries and book your ideal study spot from anywhere. Your booking holds for 45 minutes (including a grace period for travel), but if you can't make it, just cancelâ€”it's free! No-shows incur a small $1 fine and temporary booking restrictions to ensure everyone gets a fair chance at a space.
